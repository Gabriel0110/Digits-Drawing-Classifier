# Digits-Drawing-Classifier
GUI for drawing digits to be classified by an MNIST-trained model.  Just a simple little project I wanted to put together.

You can choose to train your own model by simply implementing it into the train_model() function, or you can load an MNIST digits pre-trained model by clicking "Load Model" and selecting the appropriate file.
